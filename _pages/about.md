I am a PhD student in Physical Oceanography at the University of Oxford on the [NERC DTP](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/people/tristan-pang) and am based in the [Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics department](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/pangt).

I am currently looking at the effects of **friction** on the overturning circulation in the **Southern Ocean**.
